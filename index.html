        <p>Programming is a rewarding career as well as an engaging hobby for developers. If you keep the approach to programming as a hobby than a job, you will sharpen your skills in a practical way. It can also be a fantastic way to master any new programming language.Coding and programming is super interesting. It allows people to get together to build something unique, share ideas, innovate, solve problems, and learn new things every day.</p>

        <p>I know Programig languages such as 
        HTML ,CSS ,JAVASCRIPT ,C# ,BlockBase coding.
        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers.</p>

        Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> My inspiration are Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. I have always wondered how people managed to create such vast worlds inside a TV/computer screen; how they were able to make something out of nothing; how they were able to tell a computer what to do. All of these video games made me want to follow the footsteps of the game developers. I, too, wanted to create something that would have a lasting impact on people; something that would trigger nostalgia; something that would serve as a temporary relief for people going through tough times; something that is worthwhile; something that makes people happy; something that would make me happy. Combined with my passion for learning and Mathematics, the stage was set for me to begin my programming journey.</p>
